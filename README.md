### ASSIGNMENT 2

This repository contains my solutions to Assignment 2 for DS 5030 - Understanding Uncertainty. I imported iowa.csv, and used this datafile to answer all of the questions requiring numerical data.

## How to Run
Answers to all of the assignment questions can be found in assignment_2-2.ipynb. This is a Jupyter notebook, and the code is to be run cell-by-cell. The iowa.csv file must also be in the same repo/folder as the notebook in order for it to function as intended.
